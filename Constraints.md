## Professional

Our project does have a direct impact on students' professional development. With the main goal of our tool being to prevent cheating in classrooms, it will change the way certain classes will give out exams. With our tool, each question will be specialized, changing the way larger foundational courses test their students. We do need the expertise of a professor to be willing to share an example exam as well as a solution set to test if our software can change certain slight key factors such as numbers or words to make the problem a bit different from other students. If our software is not able to generate the solutions for these different questions, it would make the life of the professor much harder and would most likely not be used or functional.

## Social

Our tool will be free to use for professors who would wish to prevent plagiarism in their classrooms. This has a benefit for our university population as it allows students to ensure they know the material and are following the student code of conduct as well as it allows the professors to accurately test each student's ability. This tool would also decrease a professor's workload exponentially as the tool would be able to create the solution sets for each exam, making the grading process much easier. 

## Ethical

Our tool does challenge one's moral compass. Our goal is to eliminate exam plagiarism, it tests the student on how well they do on their own, taking away the chance for them to cheat on their exams. When a professor uses this software, many students will most likely be upset by the use of it. We are going to ensure that there are no bugs in the program that result in incorrect solution sets that would hurt a student's score in the class. With the collaboration with professors in CEAS, we are hoping to test the program and take out any bugs that may result in incorrect answers.
