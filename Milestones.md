# Milestones
- **Decide primary language(s) for the project:** 
    - We want to choose languages that fit our needs and will be easy to work with or easy to pick up and learn over the next couple months. This is an important decision so that we can all set up our development environments and know what tools and resources are available to our team. The whole team will have their environments set up for project development.
- **Mockups for User experience:** 
    - A mockup will be created for both the web application and the mobile application. This can be done in a tool such as draw.io or something similar to photoshop. This is important for establishing expectations of how our application should look from a front-end perspective and establishing what the backend should support. These will serve as a template but if changes are decided to be made, the mockups should be updated so that there is no confusion on the vision for the final product.
- **Having a faculty member or subject of questions to use for a sample exam:** 
    - Ideally, we will be able to demonstrate our product in a real-world testing scenario with a course taught at the university. Our team will attempt to find a faculty member that would be willing to work with us towards this goal. Our backup will be establishing a mock course and creating exam questions relevant to the mock course for the purpose of demonstrating our product to the public.
- **Have a foundation for allowing a user to create problems:** 
    - This will likely be the first step to accomplish during the web development and likely the hardest. It will involve accepting input from the user for problem generation. Upon completion of this milestone, we will be able to parse user input and create a human readable, formatted question.
- **Have a foundation for generating random questions for their solutions on a backend level:** 
    - This should be much more straightforward than the previous milestone. We will take the parameters for the question that the user specifies as ones to be randomized along with the bounds they should be randomized to and from. Upon completion, we will be able to create multiple variations of the same question.
- **Have a foundation for generating solutions to the problems:** 
    - When the randomized questions are generated, their solutions will also be generated and stored with a mapping to their randomization key. These will follow another input for how the problem should be solved according to user input.
- **Allow problems and test templates to be saved for future use:** 
    - Save the information that the user creates so that they can come back into the application year after year and reuse and/or alter exams.
- **A barcode is created for each exam that links to its solution keys:** 
    - A barcode should be unique to the exam. The key represented by this barcode should link directly to its set of solutions.
- **Ease of use navigating web application:** 
    - The frontend vision for the web application has been fully realized. Team agrees that the user experience is what was envisioned from mockups.
- **Mobile application exists and a barcode can be scanned and check if the key exists in our system:** 
    - A barcode can be scanned and will be determined to be valid or invalid depending on if its value is present.
- **Scanning the barcode displays the solution set for the exam scanned:** 
    - This will be the final key functional step of the system, everything is working at a base level. Exams can be created along with their solution sets and those solutions can be viewed from a mobile application after the exam has been printed.
- **Ease of use navigating mobile application and solution set:** 
    - The frontend vision for the mobile application has been fully realized. Team agrees that the user experience is what was envisioned from mockups.
- **Test cases have been established:** - Test cases have been established based on the different aspects of the application so that we are able to adequately test and enhance our application before a public demonstration.
- **Project presentation:** 
    - Project has reached the public demonstration stage and the project has concluded.
