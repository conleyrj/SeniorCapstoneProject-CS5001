## Project Focus

The project is an automatic paper exam generator. This tool will provide randomized deviations of ‘banked’ questions for each student in the class as well as automatic solutions for the professor or TAs to grade easily. The exams will be generated from a random seed that will be represented by a barcode on the printed exam. This barcode will be able to be scanned by a mobile application that we also develop to generate a solution set for that particular exam seed. We will be creating a web application that can build problems to ‘bank’. A ‘banked’ problem will be a question that can be altered slightly so that the process to solve the ‘banked’ problem will be very similar but the answer or the numbers that will be worked with will be different.


## Role of Each Member

The Team Roles will be defined at a later date after future research is conducted. We are focused on researching the most optimal way to complete this project.
