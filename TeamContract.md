## Expected Meeting Times/ Frequency:

## Project Focus

The project is an automatic paper exam generator. This tool will provide randomized deviations of ‘banked’ questions for each student in the class as well as automatic solutions for the professor or TAs to grade easily. The exams will be generated from a random seed that will be represented by a barcode on the printed exam. This barcode will be able to be scanned by a mobile application that we also develop to generate a solution set for that particular exam seed. We will be creating a web application that can build problems to ‘bank’. A ‘banked’ problem will be a question that can be altered slightly so that the process to solve the ‘banked’ problem will be very similar but the answer or the numbers that will be worked with will be different.


## Role of Each Member

We are focused on researching the most optimal way to complete this project. While most, if not all, aspects of this project will be a collaborative effort, we have attempted to separate the primary responsibilities of each team member by assigning them the following roles. We believe these roles highlight the strengths of each member and do a good job of describing what can be expected from each team member. 

| Name        | Role        | Description of role |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Dylan Ryman | Tech lead | Final say on all technical decisions regarding the project. Will have a clear technical vision of the project at all times. |
| Melanie Mai | User Experience Lead | Final say on all UI/UX aspects of the project. Will have a clear vision of the front-facing vision of the project at all times. |
| Ryan Conley | Scrum Master | Facilitates team meetings and plans out what team needs to do to meet deadlines. Will know the status of the project at all times. |
| Neha Chawla | Testing Lead and Staff Communication | Final say on testing criteria for the project. Assuming a faculty member is willing to work with us for a sample exam with the system, will be responsible for communication with said faculty member |
